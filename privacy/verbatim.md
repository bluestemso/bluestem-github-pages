This Privacy Policy explains how Bluestem Solutions ("we", "us", "our") handles personal information when you use the Verbatim mobile app and related services (the "Service"), including APIs hosted at `https://verbatim.bluestem.solutions`.

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. Information you provide
- Account information: email address and password when you sign up or log in.
- Profile and preferences: optional profile fields such as name, avatar, language, and timezone.
- User content: audio files you share/upload, and the resulting transcriptions/translations.
- Support communications: information you send us when you contact support.

### B. Information collected during use
- Processing metadata: file format, file size, duration, processing status, usage counters, and subscription tier/status.
- Technical data: IP address, request metadata, app/device metadata, and authentication/session data needed to operate and secure the Service.
- Diagnostics data: crash and performance telemetry (for example, through Sentry) to monitor reliability.

### C. Information stored on your device
- Local app data such as cached audio files, transcription history, queued offline uploads, and session information.
- This local data is controlled by your device settings and app actions (for example, deleting content, clearing app data, or uninstalling).

## 2. How We Use Information
We use personal information to:
- create and manage accounts;
- upload, transcribe, translate, and return your voice notes;
- provide subscription/usage features and enforce plan limits;
- maintain service security, prevent abuse, and troubleshoot issues;
- improve product quality and reliability;
- comply with legal obligations.

## 3. How We Share Information
We share information only as needed to run the Service:
- Deepgram (speech-to-text processing of audio you upload).
- Google Cloud Translation (translation of transcription text).
- Sentry (error and performance monitoring).
- Cloud hosting/storage providers (app infrastructure, media storage, logs).
- Payment processors (for example, Google Play Billing and/or Stripe, depending on purchase flow).
- Service providers that help us send operational emails.

We may also disclose information if required by law, to enforce our terms, or as part of a merger/acquisition. We do not sell your personal information.

## 4. Data Retention
- Account and operational records are retained while your account is active and as needed for legitimate business/legal purposes.
- Uploaded audio, transcriptions, and translations are retained until deleted by you, removed by us under our retention practices, or your account is deleted.
- Some deletions may be delayed in backups/archival systems for a limited period.
- Billing and tax-related records may be retained longer where required by law.

## 5. Security
We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards, including encrypted transport (HTTPS) and access controls. No system is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 6. Your Choices and Rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or export your personal data, and to object to or restrict certain processing. You can:
- update certain profile information in-app;
- delete voice note records from the app;
- request account/data deletion by contacting us.

## 7. Children's Privacy
The Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 8. International Transfers
Your information may be processed in countries other than your own, including where our service providers operate.

## 9. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be posted at this location with a new "Last updated" date.
