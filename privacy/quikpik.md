# QuikPik Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 10, 2026**

This Privacy Policy explains how Bluestem Solutions ("we", "us", "our") handles personal information when you use the QuikPik mobile app (the "App").

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. Information you provide
We may receive information you provide directly, such as:
- support requests you send us by email;
- feedback you choose to submit about the App.

### B. Information collected during use
To operate and improve QuikPik, we may process limited technical data such as:
- app version, device model/OS version, and language settings;
- crash and diagnostics information;
- basic request metadata needed for app reliability and abuse prevention.

### C. Information stored on your device
QuikPik primarily works with data stored on your device. Depending on features you use, local app data may include settings, cached content, and recent usage state.

### D. Permissions
QuikPik may request device permissions needed for app functionality (for example, network access). Permissions are used only to support App features.

## 2. How We Use Information
We use information to:
- provide and maintain the App;
- diagnose crashes and performance issues;
- improve reliability and user experience;
- respond to support requests;
- comply with legal obligations.

## 3. How We Share Information
We do not sell your personal information. We may share limited information with service providers only as needed to operate the App, such as:
- Google Play Services (distribution, app updates, and platform services);
- crash/error monitoring and infrastructure providers used to keep the App reliable.

We may also disclose information if required by law, to enforce our terms, or as part of a merger/acquisition.

## 4. Data Retention
We retain information only as long as needed for operational, support, and legal purposes. If you contact us, we may retain those communications for customer support and recordkeeping.

QuikPik is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
