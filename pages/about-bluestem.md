<h2 id="content">We're a boutique consulting and automation shop</h2>
<p>I'm Taylor Schaack, the owner and principal consultant here at Bluestem. We help small and medium businesses automate their repetitive tasks so they can focus on what matters most: growing their business.</p>

<p>Named after the resilient prairie grass common in my home state of Kansas, Bluestem represents our approach: we build systems that are robust, adaptable, and designed to work reliably in your environment.</p>

		<h3>Our Mission</h3>
		<p>To help small and medium businesses eliminate repetitive work through simple, reliable automation. We believe every business deserves enterprise-grade automation without enterprise-grade complexity.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
		<h3>Our Approach</h3>
		<p>We start with proven platforms like n8n, Make, Notion, and Coda to deliver solutions faster and more cost-effectively. When these don't meet your needs, we build custom solutions using Python and JavaScript.</p>
