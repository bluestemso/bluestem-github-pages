This policy explains how Bluestem Solutions handles information submitted through this website, including our contact form.

## Website Contact Form

When you submit the contact form, we collect the information you provide, such as your name, email address, and message.

We use this information only to:

- respond to your inquiry;
- follow up about that specific request;
- maintain basic records needed for customer support and operations.

We do not use contact-form submissions for bulk marketing campaigns, and we do not sell personal information.

## Service Providers

We use third-party services to operate this website and process contact submissions (for example, Formspree). These providers process information only to help us deliver and operate the contact workflow.

## Retention

We keep inquiry information only as long as needed to respond to your request and maintain business records, unless a longer retention period is required by law.

## Your Choices

If you want us to delete prior inquiry messages or have questions about this policy, contact us at [taylor@bluestem.solutions](mailto:taylor@bluestem.solutions).
