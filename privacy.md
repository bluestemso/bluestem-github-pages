# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: December 5, 2025**

This Privacy Policy describes how Bluestem Solutions ("we," "us," or "our") handles your personal information when you use our website located at https://bluestem.solutions (the "Website") and our mobile applications available on the Google Play Store, including our automation and business solutions apps (collectively, the "Apps").

We are committed to protecting your privacy. We operate on a principle of "data minimization," meaning we only collect what is absolutely necessary to ensure our services function correctly.

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. Personal Information You Provide
We do not require you to create an account or login to use our Website or Apps. We do not collect your name, physical address, or phone number unless you voluntarily provide it to us, for example:

**Contacting Us:** If you send us an email or fill out a contact form on our Website, we will receive your email address and the contents of your message. We use this strictly to respond to your inquiry.

### B. Automatically Collected Information

**For the Website:**
Like most website operators, our hosting provider, GitHub Pages, may collect non-personally-identifying information that web browsers and servers typically make available. This may include:

- Browser type
- Language preference
- Referring site
- The date and time of each visitor request
- IP Address (This is largely used for security and DDoS protection)

**For the Mobile Apps:**
Our Apps are designed to function locally on your device. We do not transmit your data to our own external servers. However, the Apps are distributed via the Google Play Store, which may collect usage data and crash reports.

**Permissions:** Our Apps may request access to specific device capabilities (such as the generic "Internet" permission or "Prevent phone from sleeping" for timer functions). These permissions are used solely to make the App function and not to collect data about you.

## 2. Third-Party Services

We may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following reasons:

- To host our Website (GitHub Pages)
- To facilitate our Apps (Google Play Services)

**Google Play Services:**
Our Apps may use Google Play Services. Google's privacy policy regarding data they may collect via their services can be found here: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

## 3. Cookies

We do not use tracking cookies for advertising or analytics on our Website. However, our hosting provider may use essential functional cookies to ensure the website loads correctly. You can instruct your browser to refuse all cookies, but some portions of our Service may not function.

## 4. Children's Privacy

Our Apps and Website are not directed to anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete this immediately. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us.

## 5. Data Retention

If you contact us via email, we retain your emails to improve our customer service and for future reference. We do not sell your email address or share it with marketing agencies.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
